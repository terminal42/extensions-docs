# ChangeLanguage v3

*ChangeLanguage* is an extension for the [Contao CMS][1] (version 3.5 and 4.x)
which allows visitors to switch between different languages of your website.

Contao itself provides multilingual support by default, you can create unlimited
number of page trees in different languages on either the same or different
domains. *ChangeLanguage* simply adds the functionality to link pages
together and present the website visitor with a list of available languages.
